smart-pot
=========

made by [raspberry pi] &amp;&amp; [ardunio] &amp;&amp;[smart phone],
full source code for connection of digit and reality.

tinker_cpp.ino is the code on ardunio.

WWW folder contain the code on PI's server(should support python)
about deployment of server on PI, we use lighttpd
guide about lighttpd: http://www.linuxidc.com/Linux/2008-09/16008.htm

this guide didn't contain python deployment, but I guess it's not very hard.

this system coulde achieve controling and monitoring of ardunio, from PI.

core tecthnology comming from flask
